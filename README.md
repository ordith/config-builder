config-builder
==============

## What is it?
ConfigBuilder is a custom MSBuild task that can be used to build configs based on a template and parameters that you define.

You can define parameters per environment, define a current working environment to use, and define templates that the configs are based on.

ConfigBuilder is built to be simple- it is doing a simple token string replace. It does not require advanced knowledge of XSLT to create a template-based config.
